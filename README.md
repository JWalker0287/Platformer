# About

Knightfall is a side-scrolling platformer about a magical knight armed with the cheapest sword in the land who 
gets his powers from the moon and is on a quest to find secret treasure hidden in a dungeon full of goblins.
In Knightfall, the player will cut through enemies with his sword and blast them with magic fireballs.  The 
player will have to reforge their sword when the sword inevitably breaks, and can replenish their magic by 
standing in the moonlight.
